# Cybersecurity-Test-and-Validation-Scheme

Security Validation allows organizations to test an attack in their own environment safely and give them quantifiable evidence of whether this attack is prevented. Testing for Validation Security can help determine if the security systems satisfy the requirements and ensure that the product actually meets the client’s needs.

Although a company might already have security systems and tools to protect them, if it hasn’t suffered a cyber-attack, there is no way to know if the strategy in place will actually work. Some security tools might already be in place to assure the protection of an organization and give valuable data to account for certain vulnerabilities. But it is often not enough to assure the full security of the organization.
